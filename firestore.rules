/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the QR Enrollment application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset strictly controls access to registration data, allowing only
 * authenticated users to perform any operations. This ensures that
 * sensitive registration information is protected from unauthorized access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All registration data is stored in the `/registrations/{registrationId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All read and write operations require authentication.
 * - Listing registrations is not allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  Not applicable, as all access is limited to authenticated users and no role-based
 *  access control is implemented at the Firestore level.
